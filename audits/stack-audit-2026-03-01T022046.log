CURRENT STACK SUMMARY
================================================================================

Frontend (ui/):
- React 19 + TypeScript ~5.9.3

================================================================================
CORE UPGRADE — High Impact, Low Complexity
================================================================================

- [ ] pytest + httpx (backend testing)
      No test coverage exists for server/; pytest with httpx provides async-
      compatible FastAPI test client and is the de-facto standard for Python
      API testing.

- [ ] zod (frontend schema validation)
      TypeScript types exist in ui/src/schema/v1/ but provide no runtime
      validation; zod bridges compile-time types and runtime data contracts,
      eliminating silent schema drift when the real Plaid API is wired up.

- [ ] react-error-boundary (frontend resilience)
      No error boundaries exist; react-error-boundary provides declarative
      per-feature error isolation with minimal boilerplate and is the React-
      recommended approach.

- [ ] MSW — Mock Service Worker (frontend test isolation)
      Tests currently rely on FakeDataProvider; MSW intercepts HTTP at the
      network layer, making tests agnostic to the data-provider abstraction
      and preparing them for real API integration.

================================================================================
STRATEGIC UPGRADE — Medium Impact
================================================================================

- [ ] openapi-typescript (schema contract codegen)
      FastAPI already emits an OpenAPI spec at /openapi.json; openapi-
      typescript generates TypeScript types directly from that spec,
      eliminating hand-written schema/ types and preventing server-client
      drift.

- [ ] Docker Compose (local multi-service orchestration)
      Dev Container runs each service independently; a docker-compose.yml
      with ui + server + optional database services would make full-stack
      local development a single command.

- [ ] structlog or loguru (backend structured logging)
      stdlib logging produces unstructured text; structlog or loguru produce
      JSON-structured, contextual log records that integrate with log
      aggregation tools without additional parsing.

- [ ] Playwright (end-to-end testing)
      No E2E tests exist; Playwright provides cross-browser coverage with
      first-class Vite integration and component testing support, making it
      additive over the existing Vitest unit tests.

================================================================================
NICE-TO-HAVE — Optional / Low Urgency
================================================================================

- [ ] rollup-plugin-visualizer (bundle analysis)
      Vite bundles are currently unmonitored; the plugin adds a one-command
      visual treemap of bundle composition with zero runtime cost.

- [ ] @storybook/addon-a11y (accessibility testing in Storybook)
      Storybook is already configured; the addon runs axe-core rules per
      story and catches accessibility regressions early with no test-writing
      overhead.

- [ ] zustand/middleware/persist (settings persistence)
      Settings state (currency, locale) is identified in the existing audit
      as needing persistence; the middleware is already shipped inside the
      zustand package and requires no additional dependency.

- [ ] react-hook-form (form state management)
      No form library is present; if the application adds budget-entry or
      settings forms, react-hook-form provides uncontrolled-component
      performance and built-in validation integration with zod.

================================================================================
NOT RECOMMENDED
================================================================================

- [ ] Redux / Redux Toolkit
      Zustand v5 already covers all current state management needs; Redux
      would add boilerplate without architectural benefit.

- [ ] GraphQL (Apollo / URQL)
      The backend is a thin REST/Plaid passthrough; adding a GraphQL layer
      would introduce resolver complexity disproportionate to the data model.

- [ ] Next.js migration
      The project is a client-side SPA with no SSR or SSG requirements;
      migrating from Vite to Next.js would add build complexity without
      addressing any current limitation.

- [ ] SWR
      TanStack Query v5 is already in use; SWR duplicates server-state
      management capabilities and would create two competing data-fetching
      paradigms.

- [ ] Nx / Turborepo (monorepo build orchestration)
      The monorepo has two packages (ui + server) with independent build
      pipelines; a dedicated build orchestrator adds significant tooling
      overhead for a project at this scale.
